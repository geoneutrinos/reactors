      content="Antineutrinos stream freely from rapidly decaying fission products 
      within nuclear reactors and from long-lived radioactive nuclides and their 
      daughters within the Earth and the Moon. They carry important information about their shrouded 
      sources and about the fundamental properties of neutrinos themselves. The most 
      energetic of these global antineutrinos produce detectable signatures in large, 
      ultra-clear volumes of scintillating liquid, or water doped with gadolinium, 
      viewed by photomultiplier tubes. Information on sources and neutrino properties 
      traditionally results from measuring the energy spectrum rather than from mapping 
      the directions of the antineutrinos. Isolating the spectrum of a source of 
      interest requires knowledge of the spectra of background sources. We introduce a 
      web application for modeling the rate and energy spectrum of antineutrino 
      interactions from nuclear power reactors as well as from the crust and mantle of 
      the Earth and the Moon. Results are instantly available for any potential detector location. Users 
      may select the location of their device, choose one of 45 existing or potential 
      subsurface detection sites, designate a given location, or explore by moving the
      cursor over the global map. There are functions for viewing and downloading the 
      energy spectra of individual sources, calculating the significance of observing 
      the signal from a given source relative to the background from the other sources, 
      and injecting the signal from a hypothetical reactor of specified power and 
      location."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
