The two files nue_o16_xsec.csv/nuebar_o16_xsec.csv in this folder contain IBD cross section data publically available at 
SNOwGLoBES- https://github.com/SNOwGLoBES/snowglobes/tree/master/xscns
The first column is neutrino/antineutrino energy in MeV
The second column is the cross section in cm^2
Note the energy bin increments are not equal but increase with energy. Event totals need to sum accordingly.
